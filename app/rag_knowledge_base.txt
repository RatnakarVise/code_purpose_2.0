Explain the given ABAP code in detail. 
Describe the purpose of the program, meaning of each variable, field, and statement.
Explaination should be in order of the code and should not skip any piece of code (MANDATORY)
Should not miss any piece of code, explain each and every line in detail. (MANDATORY)
I want all the Select queries with fields fetched and its conditions in Detail . (MANDATORY)
All Loop's, IF and numerous code specific conditions should be explained.(MANDATORY)
All the Function Modules, BADI's, BAPI's,Form-Perform, Classes to be call in should be mentioned and explained its purpose in detail.(MANDATORY)
1. ABAP Program Structure
    An ABAP program consists of declarations, event blocks, and processing logic.
    REPORT – defines the executable program name.
    INCLUDE – used to insert reusable code blocks.
    FORM … ENDFORM – defines a subroutine (procedure).
    FUNCTION … ENDFUNCTION – reusable function modules stored in function groups.
    CLASS … ENDCLASS – object-oriented programming structure with methods and attributes.

2. Data Types & Variables
    ABAP variables are strongly typed.
    DATA var TYPE c LENGTH 10 → defines a character variable of length 10.
    CONSTANTS var TYPE i VALUE 10 → defines a constant.
    INTERNAL TABLES → dynamic arrays storing multiple rows.
    WORK AREAS → single row structures used for processing inside loops.
    Inline Declarations:
    DATA(var) = expr.
    LOOP AT itab INTO DATA(ls_row).
    SELECT … INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_tab).

3. Control Statements

    LOOP … ENDLOOP – used to iterate over an internal table.
    IF … ELSEIF … ELSE … ENDIF – conditional logic.
    CASE … WHEN … ENDCASE – multi-branch conditional logic.
    DO … ENDDO – fixed loop repetition.
    EXIT / CONTINUE – control flow inside loops.

4. Database Access (Open SQL)

    ABAP uses Open SQL to access SAP database tables.
    SELECT … INTO … – fetches single or multiple rows.
    SELECT … INTO TABLE – bulk selection into internal table.
    INSERT / UPDATE / MODIFY / DELETE – data manipulation.
    @DATA(lt_result) – inline internal table declaration for SQL result.

    Example:

    SELECT matnr werks lgort  
    FROM mara  
    INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_mara)  
    WHERE matnr = '1000'.

    In this you should mention what all fields are fetched from which table, into which table with the provided condition

5. Common ABAP Objects in Programs

    Tables: MARA, VBAK, BKPF, etc. (SAP standard).
    Structures: Work areas for holding temporary rows.
    Variables: Used for storing intermediate results.
    Messages: MESSAGE 'Text' TYPE 'E'. → error, info, success messages.

6. Purpose of Typical ABAP Code Snippets

    DATA declarations → define working variables.
    SELECT statements → fetch data from SAP tables.
    LOOP at internal table → process each row of data.
    WRITE statements → output values to SAP list screen.
    FORMs / Methods → encapsulate reusable logic.
